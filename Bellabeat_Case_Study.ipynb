Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Bellabeat believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. We have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. Their Products include:\n\n* **Bellabeat app:** The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits.\n* **Leaf:** Bellabeat’s classic wellness tracker can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. The Leaf tracker connects to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.\n* **Time:** This wellness watch track user activity, sleep, and stress. The Time watch connects to the Bellabeat app to provide you with insights into your daily wellness.\n* **Spring:** This is a water bottle that tracks daily water to ensure that you are appropriately hydrated throughout the day. The Spring bottle connects to the Bellabeat app to track your hydration levels.\n* **Bellabeat membership:** Membership gives users 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.\n\n### 1.Ask \n\n#### Key Stakeholders\n* Urška Sršen - Bellabeat's cofounder and Chief Creative Officer\n* Sando Mur - Mathematician and Bellabeat's co-founder.\n\n**Business Task** : To analyze smart device usage data to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices.

Atleast 5000 steps in day is suggested, for that bellabeat notify users in certain intervals or at specific time like in morning and evening. \n* Since users are observed to be more sedentary in the day i.e, 9-5  which are office hours, they are often be sitting for hours. This can also raise some serious health issues in long run, Bellabeat should make active reminders which notify the users to take a walk and do some warm up excercises for every 2-4 hrs. \n* We can recommend giving drinking water reminders, which help user stay hydrated. Besides tracking only activities like steps, sleep time, weight and heartrates; Bellabeat can offer sessions on eating habits, yoga etc., more often.\n* Based on sleep time analysis, Bellabeat should consider teaching some routine before sleep, which reduces the sedentary time in bed and struggle to sleep through their app. Oversleeping and Insufficient sleep have to monitored since both cause a more or less impact on rest of the day. Reminding users to sleep and wake up on time.\n* Bellabeat spring and leaf products are suggested for users who work at home or from home. Unique products can be designed which can be able to track user's activity even if users are not consious about product around them and which are comfortable to use even during sleep.\n* We observed a clear relation between higher intensity activity and calories burned so logging the activity with the an interative app/device could be a good motivator to increase your activity if any user has some kind of plan to lose weight.\n\n**Tableau Visualization Work: https://bit.ly/bellabeat_tableau**\n","metadata":{}}]}
